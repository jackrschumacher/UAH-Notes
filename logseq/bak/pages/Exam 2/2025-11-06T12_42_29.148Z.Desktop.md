- # ECN143: Principles of Microeconomics - Summary
- ### 📈 I. Foundational Concepts: Supply, Demand, and Scarcity
- #### A. The Supply and Demand Model
  This model explains the relationship between the quantity of a good that producers want to sell and the quantity that consumers want to buy. It assumes a single market, identical goods, many buyers and sellers, and that all participants have the same information.
  
  * **Demand:** According to the **Law of Demand**, consumers buy more of a good when its price is lower, holding other factors constant.
    * A change in the good's own price causes a **movement along** the demand curve (a change in quantity demanded).
    * Changes in non-price factors cause a **shift** of the entire demand curve (a change in demand). These factors include consumer income, consumer tastes, the number of consumers, and the prices of other goods.
    * **Related Goods:** Goods can be **substitutes** (used in place of another) or **complements** (consumed together).
  
  * **Supply:** The supply curve shows the relationship between a good's price and the quantity supplied. Producers are willing to supply more as the price rises.
    * A change in the good's own price causes a **movement along** the supply curve.
    * Changes in non-price factors cause a **shift** of the supply curve. These factors include production costs and the number of sellers.
  
  * **Market Equilibrium:** This occurs where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, establishing the equilibrium price and quantity.
    * **Surplus (Excess Supply):** Occurs when quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded, usually because the price is *above* equilibrium. This puts downward pressure on prices.
    * **Shortage (Excess Demand):** Occurs when quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied, usually because the price is *below* equilibrium. This puts upward pressure on prices.
- #### B. Production Possibilities and Trade
  * **Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF):** A curve showing the maximum combinations of two goods that can be produced with available resources and technology.
    * Points *on* the curve are attainable and efficient.
    * Points *inside* the curve are inefficient.
    * Points *outside* the curve are unattainable with current resources.
  * **Opportunity Cost:** The highest-valued alternative that must be given up to engage in an activity. This is represented by the trade-off along the PPF.
  * **Comparative vs. Absolute Advantage:**
    * **Absolute Advantage:** The ability to produce more of a good than a competitor using the same amount of resources.
    * **Comparative Advantage:** The ability to produce a good at a *lower opportunity cost* than a competitor.
  * **Gains from Trade:** The basis for trade is comparative advantage, not absolute advantage. When parties specialize in what they have a comparative advantage in and then trade, both can consume more than they could on their own.

- ### 🏛️ II. Market Efficiency and Government Intervention
- #### A. Economic Surplus
  * **Consumer Surplus:**  The difference between the highest price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual market price they do pay. It measures the gain consumers receive from a purchase.
  * **Producer Surplus:** The difference between the market price and the lowest price a producer would be willing to accept for a good.
  * **Deadweight Loss (DWL):** The reduction in total (consumer + producer) surplus that occurs as a result of a market inefficiency, such as a tax or price control.
- #### B. Price Regulation
  * **Price Ceiling:** A legally set *maximum* price for a good or service. If set below the equilibrium price, it can create a shortage.
  * **Price Floor:** A legally set *minimum* price for a good or service. If set above the equilibrium price, it can create a surplus.
  * **Surplus Transfer:** Regulations can move surplus from one group to another (e.g., from producers to consumers, or vice versa).
- #### C. International Trade Policies
  * **Autarky vs. Free Trade:** Autarky is a state of no international trade, while free trade is trade without government restrictions. Opening a market to imports typically lowers the domestic price and increases consumer surplus.
  * **Tariff:** A tax imposed by a government on imported goods. A tariff raises the domestic price, which:
    * Increases producer surplus.
    * Decreases consumer surplus.
    * Creates government tax revenue.
    * Causes a deadweight loss.
  * **Quota:** A numerical limit on the quantity of a good that can be imported. A quota also raises the domestic price, which:
    * Increases producer surplus.
    * Decreases consumer surplus.
    * Transfers some surplus to foreign producers who can sell at the higher price.
    * Causes a deadweight loss.

- ### 🧑‍💼 III. Consumer Behavior
- #### A. The Buyer's Problem and Budget Constraint
  Consumers face unlimited desires with limited resources, forcing them to make choices. The **budget constraint** defines what combinations of goods a consumer can afford given their income and the (fixed) prices of goods. The model assumes consumers do not save or borrow.
- #### B. Demand Elasticity
  Elasticity measures how sensitive one variable is to changes in another.
  
  * **Price Elasticity of Demand (E_D):** Measures how much quantity demanded responds to a change in price.
    * **Elastic:** $E_D > 1$.
    * **Inelastic:** $E_D < 1$.
    * **Unit Elastic:** $E_D = 1$.
  * **Elasticity and Total Revenue:**
    * If demand is **inelastic**, a price *increase* will *increase* total revenue.
    * If demand is **elastic**, a price *increase* will *decrease* total revenue.
  * **Cross-Price Elasticity:** Measures how the demand for one good changes when the price of *another* good changes.
    * **Positive:** The goods are **substitutes**.
    * **Negative:** The goods are **complements**.
  * **Income Elasticity:** Measures how demand changes in response to a change in consumer income.
    * **Normal Good:** Demand increases as income increases.
        * **Necessity:** $0 < E_I < 1$.
        * **Luxury:** $E_I > 1$.
    * **Inferior Good:** Demand *decreases* as income increases ($E_I < 0$).

- ### 🏭 IV. Producer Behavior: Production and Costs
- #### A. Production
  * **Technology:** The processes a firm uses to turn inputs into outputs.
  * **Short Run vs. Long Run:**
    * **Short Run:** A period where at least one of the firm's inputs is fixed.
    * **Long Run:** A period long enough for the firm to vary all of its inputs.
  * **Marginal Product:** The additional output produced by adding one more unit of an input.
  * **Law of Diminishing Returns:** In the short run, as a firm adds more of a variable input (like labor) to a fixed input (like capital), the marginal product will eventually decrease.
- #### B. Costs of Production
  * **Explicit vs. Implicit Costs:**
    * **Explicit Costs:** Costs that involve a direct monetary payment.
    * **Implicit Costs:** Nonmonetary opportunity costs, such as a forgone salary.
  * **Short-Run Costs:**
    * **Fixed Costs (FC):** Costs that do not change as output changes.
    * **Variable Costs (VC):** Costs that change as output changes.
    * **Total Cost (TC):** $TC = FC + VC$.
  * **Average and Marginal Costs:**
    * **Average Total Cost (ATC):** Total cost per unit of output ($TC / Q$).
    * **Average Variable Cost (AVC):** Variable cost per unit of output ($VC / Q$).
    * **Average Fixed Cost (AFC):** Fixed cost per unit of output ($FC / Q$).
    * **Marginal Cost (MC):** The change in total cost from producing one more unit of output.
- #### C. Perfect Competition
  This is an industry structure defined by four attributes:
  1.  Many firms.
  2.  A homogeneous (identical) product.
  3.  Free entry and exit from the industry.
  4.  Buyers and sellers have complete information.
  
  * **Price Taker:** A firm in a perfectly competitive market has no influence over the market price and must charge the market price.
  * **Firm's Demand Curve:** The demand curve for a single firm is a horizontal line at the market price.
  * **Revenue:** For a competitive firm, the **Marginal Revenue (MR)**—the extra revenue from selling one more unit—is equal to the market price. Therefore, $Price = Marginal Revenue = Demand$ ($P = MR = D$).
- ### 🧩 I. Game Theory and Strategic Play
- #### A. Introduction to Game Theory
  **Game theory** is the study of strategic interactions. It is used to analyze situations where the outcome for one party depends on the actions of another party.
  
  A game consists of three key elements:
  1.  **The Players**
  2.  **The Strategies** (the actions each player can take)
  3.  **The Payoffs** (the outcomes or consequences for each player, often shown in a **payoff matrix**)
  
  In a **simultaneous move game**, players select their strategies at the same time without knowing the other's choice.
- #### B. The Prisoner's Dilemma
  This is a classic example of a simultaneous move game.
  * **Players:** You and Josie, two partners in crime.
  * **Strategies:** Confess or Hold Out (don't confess).
  * **Payoffs (Jail Time):**
    * If both confess: You both get 5 years.
    * If both hold out: You both get 2 years (for a lesser charge).
    * If you confess and Josie holds out: You are released (0 years), Josie gets 10 years.
    * If Josie confesses and you hold out: Josie is released (0 years), you get 10 years.
- #### C. Dominant Strategy and Nash Equilibrium
  * **Dominant Strategy:** A player's best response, regardless of what the other player does.
    * In the Prisoner's Dilemma, "Confess" is the dominant strategy for both you and Josie. If Josie confesses, your best move is to confess (5 years < 10 years). If Josie holds out, your best move is still to confess (0 years < 2 years).
  * **Dominant Strategy Equilibrium:** An outcome where each player uses their dominant strategy. The (Confess, Confess) outcome is a dominant strategy equilibrium.
  * **Nash Equilibrium:** A situation where each player chooses a strategy that is best for them, *given the strategies chosen by the other players*. In a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy.
    * A game can have **multiple Nash equilibria**. In the "Hang Ten vs. La Jolla" advertising game, there are two: (Both Advertise, Both Advertise) and (Both Don't Advertise, Both Don't Advertise).
    * If the players are not at a Nash equilibrium (e.g., one advertises and the other doesn't), at least one player will have an incentive to change their behavior to move toward an equilibrium.

- ### 🏛️ II. Market Structures
  
  Your notes expand the spectrum of market structures beyond perfect competition, focusing on the number of firms and the degree of product differentiation.
- #### A. Monopoly
  * **Number of Firms:** One.
  * **Product Type:** A unique good or service with no close substitutes.
  * **Barriers to Entry:** Yes, barriers are high and prevent potential competitors from entering.
  * **Price Power:** A "price-maker" with the ability to set the price (market power).
  * **Demand Curve:** Faces the entire downward-sloping market demand curve.
- #### B. Oligopoly
  * **Number of Firms:** A few firms competing.
  * **Product Type:** Can be either **homogeneous** (identical, like oil or cement) or **differentiated** (similar but not identical, like cars or cigarettes).
  * **Barriers to Entry:** Yes, significant barriers exist.
  * **Price Power:** A "price-maker".
  * **Key Feature:** A high degree of **interdependence**; each firm's decisions are dependent on the actions of the other firms.
    * **Homogeneous Duopoly (2 Firms):** In a duopoly (two firms) with perfect substitutes (like the landscapers Dogwood and Rose Petal), price competition will drive the price down. The Nash equilibrium occurs when both firms charge a price equal to their marginal cost.
    * **Differentiated Oligopoly:** When products are differentiated (like Coke and Pepsi), firms can charge prices higher than marginal cost and not lose all their customers, because differentiation creates consumer preferences.
- #### C. Monopolistic Competition
  * **Number of Firms:** Many.
  * **Product Type:** Differentiated products; goods are similar but not identical. Examples include books, restaurants, and clothing.
  * **Barriers to Entry:** None; free entry and exit.
  * **Price Power:** A "price-maker" due to product differentiation, but with a recognition of other sellers.
